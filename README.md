Playdar
=======
Playdar is a music content resolver, written in Erlang, MIT licensed.
It's modular and can be extended using resolver scripts in any language.
It has an HTTP API to answer the question "can i play this song?".
If yes, you get a localhost URL that will play the song, from whichever
source playdar resolved it to (plugins do the resolving).
