Windar 0.2.1
============

   - Changed licence from GPL to LGPL.
   - Improved installer, with option to remove Application Data.
   - Reduced the total file-size of the installer.
   - Improved the Playdar state detection using the stat method.
   - Updated to Erlang R014A, and reduced to bare essentials.
   - Removed the Napster resolver and plugin. There is potential that this will
     be re-introduced in the next Windar release.
   - Removed the MPlayer-powered test player to reduce installer size. It would
     require better error for failed web requests which might be recovered.
   - Removed the Scrobbler plugin as it required an auth hack. This had been
     intended to work with the test player and may made to work indendently.
