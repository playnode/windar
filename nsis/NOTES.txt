Windar 0.2.1
============

   - Changed licence from GPL to LGPL.
   - Improved installer, with option to remove Application Data.
   - Improved the Playdar state detection using the stat method.
   - Updated to Erlang R014A, and reduced to bare essentials.
   - Removed the Napster resolver and plugin. There is potential that this will
     be re-introduced in the next Windar release.
   - Removed the MPlayer-powered test player to reduce installer size.
