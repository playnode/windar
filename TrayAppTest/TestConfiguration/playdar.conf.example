%%% Playdar configuration file.
%%%
%%% This configuration file contains Erlang terms.
%%% In case you want to understand the syntax, here are the concepts:
%%%
%%%  - The character to comment a line is %
%%%
%%%  - Each term ends in a dot, for example:
%%%      override_global.
%%%
%%%  - A tuple has a fixed definition, its elements are
%%%    enclosed in {}, and separated with commas:
%%%      {loglevel, 4}.
%%%
%%%  - A list can have as many elements as you want,
%%%    and is enclosed in [], for example:
%%%      [http_poll, web_admin, tls]
%%%
%%%  - A keyword (aka Erlang atom) is a word in lowercase.
%%%
%%%  - Strings are enclosed in "" and can have spaces, dots, etc.
%%%      {language, "en"}.
%%%      {name, "Joe"}.
%%%
%%%  - This term includes a tuple, a keyword, a list and two strings:
%%%      {dirs, ["/home/joe/music", "/mnt/music"]}.
%%%

%% Settings for the Playdar webserver.
%%
%% If you don't listen on your LAN interface then you won't be able to serve
%% files to others on your LAN using the lan resolver.
%%
%% Playdar ignores any HTTP requests that don't originate from localhost, except
%% for requests to stream valid files (typically ones resolved by lan resolver).
%%
%% "0.0.0.0" means listen on all interfaces, and is recommended.
%%
