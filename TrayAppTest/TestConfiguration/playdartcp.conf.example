% Should our node listen for incoming connections?

{listen, false}.

% Port servent listens on. Only matters if "{listen, true}." is specified
% This must be a different port to the web port (60210).
% (You may need to set up a port-fwd on your home router to accept connections)

{port, 60211}.

% Do we share our content with other playdars that connect to us?
% Defaults to false - set to true if you know that everyone who can connect to
% your machine is authorised to play the music you have. Respect copyright!
% This can also be configured on a per-connection basis, so you can connect out
% to peers offering free content (magnatune etc) without sharing, and connect 
% to your own playdar at home with sharing turned on just for you.

{share, false}.


% Peers to connect to on startup.
% third param is bool: share our content with this node (overriding default)

{peers,[
%    {"joe.example.com", 60211},
%    {"mike.example.com", 9999},
%    {"i-wish-this-existed.magnatune.com", 60211, false},
%    {"i-wish-this-existed.archive.org", 60211, false},
%    {"i-wish-this-existed.jamendo.org", 60211, false},
%    {"my-home-pc.example.com", 60211, true}
]}.


% Should queries be fwded to other active playdar-tcp connections?

{fwd, false}.

% Query broadcast delay (ms) for query fwding 
% Recommended default 500. Only matters if "{fwd, true}." is specified.

{fwd_delay, 500}.

% Should we rewrite identity of peers when acting as a proxy
% This defaults to false for now, meaning if three ppl are connected in a chain
% like so: A::B::C, A will see that results came from C (altho B still acts as
% a proxy so the IP address of C is hidden from A). If Rewriting is enabled,
% B will rewrite responses so that results appear to come from B, and the name
% of C will not be exposed to A. (This is normal behaviour for a darknet).

{rewrite_identity, false}.
