%% Should our node listen for incoming connections?

{listen, true}.

%% Port servent listens on. Only matters if "{listen, true}." is specified
%% This must be a different port to the web port (60210).
%% (You may need to set up a port-fwd on your home router to accept connections)

{port, 60211}.

%% Do we share our content with other playdars that connect to us?
%% Defaults to false - set to true if you know that everyone who can connect to
%% your machine is authorised to play the music you have. Respect copyright!
%% This can also be configured on a per-connection basis, so you can connect out
%% to peers offering free content (magnatune etc) without sharing, and connect 
%% to your own playdar at home with sharing turned on just for you.

{share, false}.

%% Peers to connect to on startup.

{peers,[
   %{"10.1.1.45", 60211, true},
   %{"10.1.1.61", 60211, true},
   %{"k-os.podzone.net", 60211, true},

]}.

%% Should queries be fwded to other active playdar-tcp connections?

{fwd, true}.

%% Query broadcast delay (ms) for query fwding 
%% Recommended default 500. Only matters if "{fwd, true}." is specified.

{fwd_delay, 500}.

%% Should we rewrite identity of peers when acting as a proxy
%% This defaults to false for now, meaning if three ppl are connected in a chain
%% like so: A::B::C, A will see that results came from C (altho B still acts as
%% a proxy so the IP address of C is hidden from A). If Rewriting is enabled,
%% B will rewrite responses so that results appear to come from B, and the name
%% of C will not be exposed to A. (This is normal behaviour for a darknet).

{rewrite_identity, false}.
